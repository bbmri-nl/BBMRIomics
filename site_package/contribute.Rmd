We welcome contributions to the
[BBMRIomics](bios-vm.bbmrirp3-lumc.surf-hosted.nl/BBMRIomics/index.html)
web-site, for example, with use-cases. The BBMRIomics web-site is
completely build using R. Especially,
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is used to generate the
complete web-site from a few Rmarkdown-files. This rmarkdown
[section](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) shows
how easy it is to generate a web-site using rmarkdown. 

## Adding a use-case ##

Modify `_site.yml` by adding a new use-case under the use-case items, e.g. 

 - `- text:  "eqtl analysis"`
 - `href: eqtl.html`
  
*beware spacing does matter!*

Now from within the `site_package` directory generate a new template using 

```bash
make newpage file=eqtl
```

This will generate `eqtl.Rmd` for you with the same settings as the
other Rmd-files in this folder. Provide your example with
documentation and use `cache=TRUE` as an argument for the R-code
chunk (maybe check one of the other Rmd-documents). 

See, for more information on [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

Check if all code chunks run without errors, optionally add a library
to `_setup.Rmd`. Now run

```bash
make render     
```

and if successfully run

```bash
sudo make publish
```
