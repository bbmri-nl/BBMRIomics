The BIOS consortium has generated for around 4000 individuals, across
six biobanks, transcriptomic and epigenomic (DNA methylation)
data. Furthermore, basic phenotypic information has been collected for
these individuals, as well as, detailed information on the data
generation, i.e., sequencing machine, flow-cell, array position on the
chip, date of hybridization, etc. Apart from the data generated and
collected by the BIOS consortium other BBMRI consortia have generated
data that can be linked to the BIOS data collection e.g., the GoNL
sequencing data and the brainshake metabolomics data (RP4). 

The aim of the `BBMRIomics`-package is to make integrated analyses,
within the BIOS data collection or across BBMRI projects, as easy as
possible, using the R-programming language[@Rsite].
