Using the R-programming language [@Rsite], theÂ BBMRIomics-package
makes integrated analyses, across BBMRI-omics datasets, as easy as
possible.

BBMRI-Omics is a collection of whole genome sequencing (BGI, N~750),
transcriptome (RNA seq, N~4,000), methylome (Illumina 450K, N~4,000),
and metabolome (Nightingale Health/Brainshake, N~25,000) data sets
generated across more than 20 human cohorts in the Netherlands
(referentie naar toekomstige website). In addition to the generated
data, imputed genotypes are available as well as detailed technical
information on data generation is provided, such as sequencing
machine, flow-cell, array position on the chip, date of
hybridization. Furthermore, phenotypic data on the individual level
such as blood measures of cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and blood
cell count. But also lifestyle factors as smoking, alcohol use in
addition to antropometric measures as body mass index.

The aim of the **BBMRIomics**-package is to make integrated analyses,
within the BIOS data collection or across BBMRI projects, as easy as
possible, using the R-programming language.

## BIOS Forum ##

We will be using the `Biostars` forum to answer any of your questions
concerning the BBMRI-Omics datasets. When using the correct tags during
creation of your post there, we can easily see it.

Please keep in mind that `Biostars` is a public forum and that any posts
you make will be visible on the main page. As such, don't post any
large snippets of data and make sure that any IDs and paths are
censored.

When posting your question, please include the following tag:

 * bbmri-nl-bios

Please also include in your title the following:

 * [bbmri-nl-bios]
 * start with the dataset in question, so Genotypes, Phenotypes, RNA-Seq or Methylation.
 * Example: "[bbmri-nl-bios] Genotypes How can I find HRC imputation qualities?"

Any questions posted this way will appear on [forum](https://www.biostars.org/t/bbmri-nl-bios/).
