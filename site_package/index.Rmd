The BIOS consortium has generated for around 4000 individuals, across
six biobanks, transcriptomic and epigenomic (DNA methylation)
data. Furthermore, basic phenotypic information has been collected for
these individuals, as well as, detailed information on the data
generation, i.e., sequencing machine, flow-cell, array position on the
chip, date of hybridization, etc. Apart from the data generated and
collected by the BIOS consortium other BBMRI consortia have generated
data that can be linked to the BIOS data collection e.g., the GoNL
sequencing data and the brainshake metabolomics data (RP4). 

The aim of the `BBMRIomics`-package is to make integrated analyses,
within the BIOS data collection or across BBMRI projects, as easy as
possible, using the R-programming language[@Rsite].

## BIOS Forum ##

We will be using the Biostars forum to answer any of your questions
concerning the BIOS datasets. When using the correct tags during
creation of your post there, we can easily see it.

Please keep in mind that Biostars is a public forum and that any posts
you make will be visible on the main page. As such, don't post any
large snippets of data and make sure that any IDs and paths are
censored.

When posting your question, please include the following tag:

 * bbmri-nl-bios

Please also include in your title the following:

 * [bbmri-nl-bios]
 * start with the dataset in question, so Genotypes, Phenotypes, RNA-Seq or Methylation.
 * Example: "[bbmri-nl-bios] Genotypes How can I find HRC imputation qualities?"

Any questions posted this way will appear on [forum](https://www.biostars.org/t/bbmri-nl-bios/).
